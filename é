Project for the course LMECA2801 – Multibody Systems Dynamics at UCLouvain.

To run the code with the second configuration, use the following command from the home directory:
```
python3 main.py two_supports.txt <sim_name>
```
Where <sim_name> is an arbitrary name

The comparisons with the first case can be plotted with 
```
python3 make_plots.py <sim_name>
```
And the beams can be seen with
```
python3 draw_beams.py <sim_name>
```
